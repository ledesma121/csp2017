     <h1><font color="gold">After ending our league with a 9-4 record and making playoffs being in 2nd place.Deleno Tigers were our matchup for playoffs.They were holding a 6-10 record.We were confident on this game and we knew Arvin was scared to play us again.</font></h1>
     <img src="images/stats.PNG" height="250">
     <h1><font color="gold">In the end being over confident was what lost us the game against Deleno 3-0.With starters being out and injuies early in game.The game didnt go our way.Arvin then beat Deleno and went on to fight for Valley Champs but ended up losing to Lisndey.We could have beat Arvin and went on to valley but soccer is about being consistent we werent and had good games then bad games.As this 2016-2017 is the past we focus on the 2017-2018 year and plan to go farther.</font></h1>
